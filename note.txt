Every Frame A Pause Inspired Breakdowns

NLP Research: Flowchart Fiction (Entity, Relation), Flowchart Argument (Claim, Warrant)


Focus more on actions and events
Like a historian
Fabulas. Constructing a history of entities (Characters + Place + Time) + Relations

Event Extraction
Game Based Event Planning Fiction?

- Looking at how Fictional Discourse Units are Structured
	- Still looking for more right now, but the main ones I see are just mainly things like
	- <Frodo, has enemy, Sauron> and <Frodo, has friend, Sam> - KnowF https://openreview.net/pdf?id=8smkJ2ekBRC
	- Similar -> https://cdn.aaai.org/ocs/ws/ws0271/15067-68456-1-PB.pdf
	- Found an interesting thesis https://rinekeverbrugge.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thesisDouweTerluin2008.pdf
		- Talks about the idea of a 'fabula' which is a knowledge structure containing events in fictional story.
		- Lists types of relations, like "Event physically causes event", "Internal element motivates action"
        - Fabula -> Vector Embedding
    - Another interesting thesis http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~delson/pubs/Modeling-Narrative-Discourse_Elson_R4.pdf
