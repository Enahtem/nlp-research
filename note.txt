5/6/2024 Meeting

- Worked on Understanding and Building a RST Discourse Segmenter repository with an F1 Score of 97 compared to Soricut and Marcu's 85
	- Is there online computing resource that I can access? Don't think I have the resources to train this.
	- http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.135.pdf

- I made a very simple proof-of-concept program that takes in simple statements, gets entity/relations triplets and graphs them.

- Looking at how Fictional Discourse Units are Structured
	- Still looking for more right now, but the main ones I see are just mainly things like
	- <Frodo, has enemy, Sauron> and <Frodo, has friend, Sam> - KnowF https://openreview.net/pdf?id=8smkJ2ekBRC
	- Similar -> https://cdn.aaai.org/ocs/ws/ws0271/15067-68456-1-PB.pdf
	- Found an interesting thesis https://rinekeverbrugge.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thesisDouweTerluin2008.pdf
		- Talks about the idea of a 'fabula' which is a knowledge structure containing events in fictional story.
		- Lists types of relations, like "Event physically causes event", "Internal element motivates action"
        - Fabula -> Vector Embedding
    - Another interesting thesis http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~delson/pubs/Modeling-Narrative-Discourse_Elson_R4.pdf

Research Proposal: Iterative Knowledge Graphs from Fiction
- Parsing: Parse Text into Discourse Units
- Extraction: Extract Entities/Relations from Discourse Units
- Evolution: Sequentially Updating Knowledge Graph with Entities/Relations

Parsing: Professor Penn emphasized I should first work on parsing text into discourse units
- I found a 'discourse-segmenter' GitHub repository that I think I got working, but when the model starts training, my laptop basically freezes
- https://github.com/takshakpdesai/discourse-segmenter
- Supposedly performs better (Section 4.1 of its paper) than Soricut/Marcu paper Professor Penn mentioned.

Extraction: You mentioned we should discuss entity/relations of fictional text
- What type of knowledge graph are we creating? https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04835.pdf
- Found Cuong Xuan Chu's thesis on "Knowledge Extraction from Fictional Texts"
- Involves Entyfi (Entity Extraction) and KnowFi (Relation Extraction)
- Link to Entyfi: https://d5demos.mpi-inf.mpg.de/entyfi
- Explain KnowFi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFTlUjdlreo

Evolution: Kind of fuzzy on the part where you add the knolwedge unit (Entities/Relations) to Knowledge Graph one at a time
- Dynamic Knowledge Graphs, Knowledge Graph Evolution. (Knowledge graph updates as new knowledge comes in)
- How would a knowledge graph handle something like a plot twist or unreliable narrator in the fiction?
